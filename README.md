# Species shifts in the Mid-Altantic Fisheries Management Area
GMRI's work for the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council to evaluate species distribution shift indicators and develop a framework to support fisheries governance of shifting stocks.

# Objectives
*Phase 1*  
Objective 1: Review current data sources and state of knowledge on species and fishery distribution changes for Mid-Atlantic managed species.  
Objective 2: Synthesize species and fishery distribution changes for Mid-Atlantic managed species.

*Phase 2*  
Objective 3: Identify and evaluate potential species and fishery distribution indicators relevant to fisheries governance, and test these indicators with a set of selected species.  
Objective 4: Develop a framework for continued monitoring and integration of species and fishery distribution indicators into decision-making processes.
